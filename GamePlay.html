<h1><strong>Gameplay</strong></h1>
<p>This is how the Game play works in the show. While it is similar to what I am building, I am only basing mine off of this. Some Notable Changes would be the addition of Asteriods, AI, and Mechas (Which are mentioned at a later point in the episode as a joke but are never actually seen being used).</p>

	Base-Game Elements:
</h1>
</div>
<div>
<h3>
	Main Fleet/Ship
</h3>
<p>
	This emelement is controled by the player with the WASD or arrow keys. This is the main unit in the game, and is the only fully player controlled unit. During Fleet Battles, you will automatically fire at any fleet in range of the ship (About 100px). You are also allowed to break up your fleet into multiple smaller fleets, with a max of 20. You get a Bonus if you surrond the Enimy with these ships, however, the more fleets you have the harded it is to control all of them. During Ship battles, the player controls the ship the same as the fleet, but the ship does not auto lock on and the player must fire manually. Ships move faster than fleets. 
</p>
</div>
<h3>
	Satilites
</h3>
<p>
	In order to further your field of view you can launch satilites. Each Fleet has 20 Satilites that they can send out and return, and individual ships have 5. Satilites cannot shot and has 1/3 the field of view as the main ship.
</p>
<h3>
	Fleet Break Up
</h3>
<p>
	When you break up your fleet, you can select which one to control with the number pad and the buttons on the side of the screen. These fleets can move faster than the larger fleet, and have 1/2 of the FoV of the Original Fleet. The Advangtage of breaking ships up is to Surrond the enemy or to cover a larger area

<h1>Later Elements</h1>
<h2>These are elements that will be added with subsiquient updates.</h2>
<h3>Mobile Suits</h3>
<p>
	Popularized by the Gundam TV show, Mechs are large fighting huminoid robots that move fast and have a attack output. Fleets have 3 mobile suit units, each constiting of 5 units. These units will be controlled by an AI, but the player will have the ability to command them where to go. I plan on realeasing these in a later update of the game in order for me to profect my coding skills and to fix problems with the original game.
